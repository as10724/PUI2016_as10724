## Assignment 1

It was done in group with Geoff, Victor, Richard and Adrien 



## Assignment 2

It was done using a different methodology than proposed in the skeleton.


# Assignment 3: Practice formulating the null hypothesis

Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

## 1 Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?

Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

Hypothesis: Diet helps lose more fat than the exercise.

NULL Hypothesis: Average percentage of fat lost by dieting in the test sample is same or less than the average percentage of fat lost by the exercise in control sample. p-value = 0.05

Ho: %age of fat loss dieting (test group) <= %age of fat loss exercising (control group)



## 2 Do American trust the president?

POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23). Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.

Hypothesis: People don't trust the honesty and integrity of Bill Clinton in capacity of the president.

NULL Hypothesis: Percentage of people who voted in the public opinion poll that they trust the honesty and integrity of Bill Clinton in capacity of the president is same or more than the percentage of people that dont trust the honesty and integrity of Bill Clinton in capacity of the president. p-value = 0.05

Ho: %age of yes vote >= %age of no vote


## 3 Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking.

Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.

Hypothesis: Cessation rate for smokers using nicotine patch is higher than ones using placebo patch. 

NULL Hypothesis: Average Cessation rate for  for smokers using nicotine patch is same or lower than average cessation rate in placebo patch users. p-value = 0.05

Ho: Rate of cessation (nicotine patch) <= Rate of cessation (placebo patch)


## 4 Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.

Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

Hypothesis: IQ of childern of non-smoking pregnant women at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 is higher than childern of women who smoked during their pregnancy. 

NULL Hypothesis: Median IQ of children of women who smoked during their pregnancy is same or higher than the media IQ of children whoes mothers didn't smoke during their pregnancy. p-value = 0.05

Ho: Median IQ (smokers) >= Median IQ (non-smoker)
